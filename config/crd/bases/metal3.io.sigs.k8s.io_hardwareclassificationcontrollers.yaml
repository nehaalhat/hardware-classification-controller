                \n This field should not be set for transitive errors that a controller
                faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over time (like
                service outages), but instead indicate that something is fundamentally
                wrong with the BaremetalMachine's spec or the configuration of the
                controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples of
                terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the spec,
                values that are unsupported by the controller, or the responsible
                controller itself being critically misconfigured. \n Any transient
                errors that occur during the reconciliation of BaremetalMachines can
                be added as events to the BaremetalMachine object and/or logged in
                the controller's output."
